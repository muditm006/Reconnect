"RECONNECT" was created by Mudit Marwaha and Jennifer Chiou in August of 2021. 

This was submitted to the StemWarriors Hackathon.

```html
<p id="CSS">In this project we coded a website using HTML.</p>
```

```javascript
var javascript= alert(The backend of the website was in Javascript!)
```

```CSS
  /*And the styling was in CSS!*/
  #CSS
  {
    color: blue;
  }
```

## PLEASE READ

For those cloning our repository:
The google maps on the Events tab will give you a message that says "This page can't load Google Maps correctly.", this is because our website uses a free API Key, and is not attatched to a paid google account. Please just close the pop up out, all functionality that we have added is still functional on this map!
